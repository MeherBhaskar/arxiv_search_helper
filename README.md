# ArXiv Research Assistant üî¨üìö

A powerful AI-powered research tool that helps you navigate the vast world of scientific literature on arXiv. Using advanced natural language processing and semantic search capabilities, it finds, ranks, and summarizes research papers that are most relevant to your query.

## Key Features

### üéØ Intelligent Paper Discovery
- Performs targeted searches on arXiv using your research queries
- Smart ranking system using semantic similarity to identify the most relevant papers
- Automatically extracts and processes paper abstracts and metadata

### üß† Advanced AI Processing
- Uses state-of-the-art embedding models for semantic understanding of research papers
- Implements vector-based similarity search for precise paper ranking
- Generates concise, informative summaries of complex research papers
- Answers questions about the papers using advanced language models

### üí™ Robust Architecture
- Adaptive model loading system that works across different computing environments
- Graceful fallback to simpler models when needed, ensuring consistent functionality
- Efficient vector storage and retrieval using FAISS
- Comprehensive error handling for reliable operation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management
- (Optional) Hugging Face API token for access to more advanced models

### Quick Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeherBhaskar/arxiv_search_helper.git
cd arxiv_search_helper
```

2. Set up the environment:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. (Optional) Configure your Hugging Face token:
   - Add your token to `config.py` or
   - Set as environment variable: `export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_token_here`

### Usage

1. Start the assistant:
```bash
poetry run python arxiv_search.py
```

2. Enter your research query when prompted
   - Try specific queries like "quantum computing applications in finance"
   - Use natural language questions
   - Type 'exit' to quit

The assistant will:
- Search for relevant papers
- Rank them by semantic similarity
- Generate summaries
- Provide answers based on the papers' content

Query: quantum computing applications

Answer: Quantum computing applications span various fields including finance, cryptography,
optimization, and machine learning. In finance, quantum algorithms can improve portfolio
optimization and risk assessment. For cryptography, quantum computers pose both threats to
current encryption methods and opportunities for quantum-secure protocols. In optimization,
quantum approaches can solve complex problems more efficiently than classical methods.
Machine learning benefits from quantum computing through faster training and more complex
model capabilities. Recent research has focused on near-term applications using NISQ devices,
showing promising results despite current hardware limitations.
